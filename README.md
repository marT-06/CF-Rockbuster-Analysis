# Recomendations
 - Concentrate more on the markets of India, China, and the United States because they have by far the most existing clients and revenue.
 
 - The categories of "Sport," "Foreign," "Family," "Documentary," and "Animation" should be expanded because they are the most profitable.
  
 - Customers who have a high lifetime value should be rewarded for their loyalty.

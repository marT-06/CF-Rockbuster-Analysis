Here is a SQL query for customers with a high lifetime value location:

SELECT 
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment E
INNER JOIN customer A ON E.customer_id=A.customer_id
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, D.country, C.city
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;

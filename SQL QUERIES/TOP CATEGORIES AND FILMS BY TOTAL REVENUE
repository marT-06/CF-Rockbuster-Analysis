Here is a SQL query for top categories and movies by revenue:


WITH profitable_films_cte AS
(SELECT A.title,
		SUM(D.amount) AS total_amount
FROM film A
INNER JOIN inventory B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
INNER JOIN rental C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN payment D  ON C.rental_id = D.rental_id

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10),
film_category_name_cte AS
(SELECT A.title,
 		C.name
 FROM film A
 INNER JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
 INNER JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id
 GROUP BY 1,2)
 SELECT  profitable_films_cte.title,
 		film_category_name_cte.name AS category,
		total_amount
FROM profitable_films_cte, film_category_name_cte;
